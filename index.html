                <p>Hi, I'm Ethan Harris. I'm 23 years old and come from a small village in South Wales. I have a deep fascination with cutting-edge technology and its applications in the defense industry. My passion lies in exploring innovative solutions to complex challenges and contributing to the advancement of this crucial field.</p>
                <p>I'm currently a student studying Computer Science. I'm on year two of my four year course and have been exposed to many different modules that range from programming in C++ and Python to making databases and using SQL to query them.</p>
                <p> I'm very interested in learning about robotics and autonomous systems within the defence industry and how intelligent systems are used within the defence industry to keep people safe.</p>
                <p>Below are some examples of these systems in different environments:</p>

                        <p>Learning C++ in my current year of studies has helped me understand more complex programming tasks, especially relating to object orientated programming. As I progress throughout this year I will be exposed to learning different data structures and algorithms as the year progresses.</p>

                        <p>I’ve been learning various tech skills during my time at university, as I am interested in robotics I have been working with arduino products to create small projects to practice valuable skills.</p>

                            <p>I have played games as a hobby all of my life especially first person shooters. I think games can actually have a positive impact and develop your problem solving skills if played as a hobby. </p>
                            <p>I think playing games as had a positive effect on my life as I have friends that also play the same games which makes gaming a social thing as well as a fun hobby.</p>

                            <p>This is a new hobby for me and I have only been playing chess around a month. I think chess has a lot of great benefits and also helps with developing your problem solving skills.</p>
                            <p>I think a game such as chess can sharpen your mind and put you into a position where you want to learn more which is always a good thing.</p>

                        <p>This website was built to educate new players to the game where they can go to gain the best loot possible. Simply click on the location you want to go and the guide will give you the best spots to go.</p>
                        <p>This project still isn't finished but I really enjoyed working on this as I am a big fan of the game also.</p>
