                <p>Hi, I'm Ethan Harris. I'm 23 years old and come from a small village in South Wales. I have a deep fascination with cutting-edge technology and its applications in the defense industry. My passion lies in exploring innovative solutions to complex challenges and contributing to the advancement of this crucial field.</p>
                <p>I'm currently a student studying Computer Science. I'm on year two of my four year course and have been exposed to many different modules that range from programming in C++ and Python to making databases and using SQL to query them.</p>
                <p> I'm very interested in learning about robotics and autonomous systems within the defence industry and how intelligent systems are used within the defence industry to keep people safe.</p>
                <p>Below are some examples of these systems in different environments:</p>
